# IA02 - Unsplash photo gallery

Course: Advanced Web Application Development
Course code: CQ2021/3
Lecturer: Nguyen Huy Khanh

## Objective

Build a React app that fetches and displays a list of photos from the Unsplash API. When a user clicks on a photo, a detailed view of that photo, including its title, author, and description, should be shown.

## Requirements

##### Display a Grid/List of Photos

-   Fetch a list of photos from the Unsplash API using their public API.
-   Display the photos in a responsive grid or list view on the page.
-   Each photo should display a thumbnail (a small version of the image) and the author’s name.

##### Infinite Scroll (Scroll to Load More)

-   As the user scrolls down the page, loads more photos automatically from the Unsplash API.
-   Use pagination or the "page" parameter from the Unsplash API to fetch additional pages of photos.
-   Add a loading indicator that shows when new photos are being fetched.
-   Handle cases where there are no more photos to load (end of list).

##### View Photo Details on Click

-   When a user clicks on any photo, navigate to a detailed view of that specific photo.
-   In the detailed view, show the following:
    -   The full-size image.
    -   The photo title (if available) or placeholder text.
    -   The author’s name.
    -   The photo description (if available) or placeholder text.

##### Navigation and Routing

-   Use React Router or equivalent library for navigation between the list of photos and the detailed photo view.
-   Implement appropriate URLs such as `/photos` for the list and `/photos/:id` for the detailed view.

##### API Integration

-   Use the Unsplash API to fetch data. You’ll need to sign up for an API key at Unsplash Developers.
-   Use the official API endpoint to retrieve the list of photos and individual photo details.
-   Handle loading states and errors appropriately while fetching data.

##### Styling and Responsiveness

-   The UI should be responsive for both desktop and mobile screens.
-   Add some basic styling, but the emphasis is more on functionality than appearance. Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Material UI, or plain CSS.
